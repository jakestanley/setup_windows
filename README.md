- Chrome - main browser
- CCCP (Includes MPC. Trying this instead of VLC)
- PuTTY
- 7-Zip - WinRAR without the guilt
- Steam
- iTunes (I need to import my iTunes library)
- Spotify
- Paint.NET - best drawing tool on Windows IMO
- LibreOffice
- Adobe Reader
- Dropbox
- TeamViewer
- Firefox - backup browser
- FileZilla
- Everything - this is one I want to try out
- WinMerge - trying this one too as a Windows alternative to Kdiff3

####Runtimes

Ninite can install the following runtimes so I select these too. There's less chance of chaffing when doing stuff in Windows if you install these ballache dependencies in advance.

- .NET
- Java x64 JDK (Includes JRE)
- Silverlight
- Adobe Air
- Shockwave

##Configuration

- Partition drives and create Linux boot partition (if applicable)
- Configure paging file
- Set power options and disable random waking from sleep
- Configure VPN profile for work (if applicable)
- Set wallpaper
- Install software
- Set Steam library
- Set Steam games off downloading
